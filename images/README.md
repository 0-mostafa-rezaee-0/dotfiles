<h1 align="center">Images Directory</h1>

This directory contains image assets and visual resources used in your dotfiles repository.

## Contents

### banner.png
A banner image that may be used for:
- Repository documentation
- README files
- Project presentations
- Social media sharing

### banner.png:Zone.Identifier
A Windows Zone Identifier file that contains metadata about the banner.png file. This file is automatically created by Windows when files are downloaded from the internet or transferred from other zones. It's safe to ignore or delete this file.

## Usage

These images are typically referenced in:
- Main README.md files
- Documentation
- Project presentations
- Social media posts about the repository

## File Management

- **Keep images optimized**: Ensure images are compressed and optimized for web use
- **Use appropriate formats**: PNG for images with transparency, JPG for photographs
- **Maintain reasonable file sizes**: Large images can slow down repository cloning
- **Version control**: Images are tracked in Git, so changes are versioned

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames
- Include alt text when referencing images in documentation
- Consider creating different sizes for different use cases
- Keep the repository size manageable by optimizing images

## Note

The Zone Identifier file (`banner.png:Zone.Identifier`) is a Windows-specific metadata file that can be safely ignored or removed. It doesn't affect the functionality of your dotfiles.

<h1 align="center">Vim Configuration Directory</h1>

This directory contains Vim configuration files that customize your Vim editor experience for improved productivity and functionality.

## Files

### .viminfo
The Vim info file that stores various information about your Vim sessions, including:
- **Command history**: Previously executed commands
- **Search history**: Previously used search patterns
- **File marks**: Marks set in different files
- **Buffer information**: Information about previously edited files
- **Register contents**: Contents of various Vim registers
- **Jump list**: History of cursor positions for navigation

#### What .viminfo preserves:
- **Command-line history**: Commands you've typed in command mode
- **Search patterns**: Regular expressions used with `/` and `?`
- **File marks**: Marks set with `m` command
- **Buffer list**: List of files you've edited
- **Register contents**: Text stored in named and numbered registers
- **Cursor positions**: Last cursor position in each file

## Installation

This file is automatically linked to your home directory when you run the `install.sh` script:
- `.viminfo` â†’ `~/.viminfo`

## Usage

After installation, Vim will automatically:
- **Save session information** when you exit Vim
- **Restore previous state** when you start Vim
- **Maintain command history** across Vim sessions
- **Remember file positions** for quick navigation

## Benefits

- **Persistent history**: Your command and search history persists across sessions
- **Quick navigation**: Jump back to previous cursor positions with `''` or `Ctrl-O`
- **Command recall**: Use arrow keys or `:` to recall previous commands
- **Search recall**: Use `/` and arrow keys to recall previous searches
- **Mark persistence**: File marks are preserved between sessions

## Customization

The `.viminfo` file is automatically managed by Vim, but you can control its behavior through Vim settings:
- **viminfo option**: Controls what information is saved
- **history option**: Controls how many commands are remembered
- **File size**: Vim automatically manages the file size

## Best Practices

- **Don't edit manually**: Let Vim manage this file automatically
- **Backup regularly**: Include in your dotfiles backup strategy
- **Version control**: Track changes to understand Vim usage patterns
- **Clean occasionally**: Vim automatically manages file size, but you can clear it if needed

## Note

The `.viminfo` file is automatically created and managed by Vim. It's safe to delete if you want to start fresh, but you'll lose your command history and other session information.
